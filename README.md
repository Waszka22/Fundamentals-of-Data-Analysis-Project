# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project

## Introduction
This repository is used for the project given by the lecture on
Fundamentals of Data Analaysis module on Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics at ATU.  

### Problem Statement

• The project is to create a notebook investigating the variables and
data points within the well-known iris flower data set associated
with Ronald A Fisher.
• In the notebook, you should discuss the classification of each
variable within the data set according to common variable types
and scales of measurement in mathematics, statistics, and Python.
• Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate summary
statistics to describe each variable.
• Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate plot(s) for
each variable.
• The notebook should follow a cohesive narrative about the data
set.
